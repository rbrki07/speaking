# A journey towards end-to-end observability for Single Page Applications

Observing Single Page Applications (SPA) can be a challenging task. Different tech stacks in the frontend and the backend can result in a complex observability setup. While observing a Spring Boot backend might be familiar to some developers, observing a React frontend is certainly something new and ambitious because the browser is far away and not under our control. And last but not least, bringing together all the telemetry data from the frontend and the backend in a meaningful and usable way should not be overlooked.
In this talk, we will follow the journey of a full stack developer that is going to instrument the Spring Boot backend and the React frontend of a SPA, that is deployed to production as a Native Image. We will discover the current state of observability for the backend and the frontend, how distributed tracing can be achieved, and how all the telemetry data can be collected and analyzed in an Open Source self-hosted telemetry backend. Finally, we will briefly explore some common Site Reliability Engineering patterns, that will help our developer to leverage the collected observability data to ensure that the SPA is delivered reliably and within user expectations.
