# René Wilby public speaking

Helping other people to achieve their goals is a great motivation for me. This is a lot about sharing knowledge and educating. Whether through blog posts, active participation in communities or as a university lecturer and trainer. I want to continue this passion by giving talks at meetups, user groups and conferences.
